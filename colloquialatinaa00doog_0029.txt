Colloquium No'mcm. 2 3

2. All the compounds of sum, except possum and absum,
take the dative as object.

3. We have learned that the personal endings of the Latin
verb take the place of the personal p1·on0unS‚ but the latter are
expressed when we wish to indicate emphasis or contrast. Try
to explain their use in this exercise.

4. A few compound verbs, including oc-curro, follow the rule
given in note 2 for compounds of sum.

5. Cf. Eng. fortuitously.

6. Cf. Eng. caloric.

7. Cf. Eng. alien.

8. Indirect object of ᾱῑΧῑ.

9. esse is the present infinitive of sum. All verbs of saying,
perceiving‚ and the like, require tlte infim'tive, (md tlte subject oftlze
z'nfinitz've is put in the accusative. This use arises from a differ-
ence between the English and the Latin idiom. In English we
say, “I said tlzat the way was broad ς ” but in Latin we have no
conjunction corresponding to tlzat5 hence we say, “I said the way
to be broad— ᾶῐΧῑ viam latam esse,‘’ where to be is an infinitive.
The subject of the infinitive is put in the accusative because it
is regarded in the first instance as the object of the verb on which
the infinitive depends3 hence, above, viam is the object of dixi
as well as the subject of esse.

10. Resides the above use of the infinitive‚ we have another,
which corresponds to an English usage. Verbs of z'ncomplete
predz‘catz'on complete tlzez'r predicate willa an zbfiniffive, e.g. Pos-
sum regnare, l am able TO REIGN. Here J am able requires
another action of the same subject to complete its predicate, and

an infinitive supplies this want in each language.
