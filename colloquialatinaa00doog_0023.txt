Colloquz'nm Sextum. 1 7

too late good-night
F. Sero est. De leone postea narrabo. Optime vale.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS.

1. Diminutives are sometimes formed in Latin by adding
culuS, cula, or culum to noun stems‚ eg. soror-cula.

2. Cf. Eng. master.

3. The Eng. morose, and the failing commonly, though Ihope
falsely, attributed to teachers, will suggest the correct translation.

4. Observe the order of words.

5. What is the English derivative?

6. Notice that the adjective is here placed before the noun.
What effect does that have on the sense? Try to find other
cases.

7. Although this verb is of the 2d conj., still your knowledge
of the 1st conj. should enable you to tell its tense, person, and
number correctly.

8. That by means of wlticlz anything is done is put in the
ablative case without a preposition‚ called the Ablative of ,Means
or Instrument.

9. am5b6 te: lit. I shall like yoqung. please, I pray.

You have been taught to expect the verb, unless it is emphatic,
last in the sentence3 but observe from this colloquium, that tlze

forms of sum are frequently placed elsewhere.

Be prepared either to ask or to answer the following with
books closed:—
