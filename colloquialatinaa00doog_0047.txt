NOTES AND QUESTIONS.

1. quidem. What do you notice about its position?

2. The place in wlzz'clz. N Β. ——Every relation of place, via,
in, to, orsrom which, requires a preposition willz its proper case,
excepling when we use names of towns and tlte words domus
and rus, which omit tlte preposition.

3. How are adverbs formed from adjectives?

4. Decline filia.

5. Latin once had a special case to express the case in wlzz'clz,
called the locatz‘ve, which has now disappeared except in the
singular number of the first and second declensions, where it
still remains, assuming the form of the genitive singular. Its
use even here, however, is limited to names of towns and the
locatives domi, τῡτῑ, humi, militiae, and belli Roma, being
of the first declension and in the singular number, has there-
fore a locative‚ Romae z at Rome, in form like the genitive

sincrular.
ἔ. Why do we omit the preposition before Romam and use

it before Graecia?

7. Athenis is the name ofa town, and of the first declension,
but it has no locative because it is plural (Athenae, -arum).
Cf. n. 5. It therefore follows n. 2.

8. What case answers the question How long?

9. What verbs take two accusatives?
