HIS is a fascinating story, by one of the most charming of French
writers, and well suited to the class-room. It has an historica]
background, the scene being laid in Paris just at the beginning of the
French Revolution, and the notes are intended not only to explain
any difficulties that may occur in the text, but also to throw light on
the historical allusions. The language is so simple that it can be
read by pupils who ’have had only a little experience in reading
French. It is well adapted for a first text after leaving the Reader,
or would be suitable for sight reading in any college class.
