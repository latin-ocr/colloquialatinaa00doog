German conversation.

Praetieal Lessons to accompany all German Grammars. By A. L. MEISSNER‚
Ph. D„ Professor of Modern Languages in Queen’s College, Belfast, Ireland;
original author of Joynes-Meissner German Grammar. 260 pages. Cloth. In-
troduction price, 75 cents. Price by mail, 85 cents.

* HIS is not a phrase book, nor a mellzod book of any style, but a

scheme of rational conversation, based on the elementary knowl-
ι dge of grammar, and following the natural development of thought
and language. Exercises in reading, memorizing, dictation and con-
versation are combined with a skill and tact worthy of Dr. Meissner's
eminent reputation. The materials are neither trivial nor abstruse,
but hit the happy mean of true conversation, covering a wide range
of important and practical topics.

The book is not only, as its title declares, “A Companion to all
German Grammars,’⁷ but is equally adapted to every method of in-
struction. No book of equal ability and merit has ever been offered
on this susject.

Onkel mad N iclzte.

An original story. By OSCAR FAULHARER, Professor of German, Phillips
Exeter Academy, N. H. (34 pages. Cloth. Price, by mail, 18 cents. Intro-
duction price, 15 cents.

HIS story is a picture of German life in its variety, describing the

features of different classes of political, civil and military soci-
ety. The military life bears on the historical period of Napoleon I.
The book touches upon the education of youth in that period, upon
national festivals, social life, travel, customs, traditions, and art as
found in the galleries, with glimpses ot German history, and refer-
ences to other historical events. Words of foreign origin, unless
thoroughly incorporated in the language, have been carefully avoided;
the purity of the Saxon or Germanic idiom is maintained; the con-
structionis not too complicated, and the style, changing from descrip-
tive to narrative, will afford the student excellent drill in translation
or in reading at sight, and will secure a rich and varied vocabulary,
a matter of prime importance to the students wishing to thoroughly

appreciate the spirit of German literature.
