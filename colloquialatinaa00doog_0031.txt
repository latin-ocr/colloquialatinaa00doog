C alloquium Decimum. 25

NOTES AND QUESTiONS.

1. We have now had τῇ, tibi, and te, the nominative, dative,
and accusative, respectively, of the pronoun of the second per-
son. Do you think te is emphatic here?

2. Construction? See Ex. IX, n. 10.

3. What is the difference between mens and animus?

4. Construction? See Ex. IX, n. 9.

5. Cf. Eng. dszintegrate, integer.

6. See Ex. VII, n. 2.

7. Construction?

8. Rememher that verbs which take two accusatives, one the
person, and the other the thing, retain the accusative of the thing
in the passive, the accusative of the person becoming the sub-
ject; eg. Act.: Catonem sententiam rogat, He asks Cato leis
opinion. Pass.: Cato sententiam rogatur, Cato is asked leis
opinion.

9. Whenever the preposition by is followed by a proper
noun or a word meaning a person or persons, it is expressed by
ἒ or ab and the ablative; this is called the Ablative of Agent.
This construction must be carefully distinguished from the Abla-
tive of Means, which does NOT refer to persons, and which omits
the preposition.

Be prepared either to ask or to answer the following with
books closed:—

N6nne nosti senatores Flaccum et Pisonem? Cur Piso in
concilio nonfuit? Quid mentem tuam occupat? Ubi est Car-
thago? Quot bella Punica fuerunt? Quis Scipio fuit? Esne
paratus prc‘) patria pfignare? Estne ιῖ consule in ablativo in-
strt‘lmenti an in ablativo agentis? Narra mihi regulam (le
ablativo agentis Anglice aut Latine? Quae fuit sententia Ca·
tonis?
