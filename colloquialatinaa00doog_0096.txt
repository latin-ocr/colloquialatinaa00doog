HIRTEEN short, pure and unusually interesting stories‚ for early

reading. As they were all first published in 1887, they are em-
phatically modern French. In his choice ot selections the author was
ever influenced by a desire to produce such as dealt with the every-
day occurances of life, thus affording teachers as well as students the
best material for varied topics of conversation. The notes are very ⁴
full and are well calculated to lead the student to a knowledge of the

spirit and idionis of the French language.
