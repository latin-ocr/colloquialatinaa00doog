ners' books, they have been so carefully graded that they can
be used to advantage in connection with any book. The obvi-
ous limitations of the book have proved an obstacle to the
excellence of the Latin, but an earnest effort has been made
to admit nothing doubtful or unidiomatic. The author feels
that he may not have been altogether successful in this direc-
tion‚ and will gladly welcome any criticism on whatever may
have escaped his vigilance.

The notes aim to assist the acquirement of a vocabulary by
referring to English cognates and derivatives, and also contain
much grammatical information epitomized or generalized to suit
the wants of a student at that stage of advancernent. Acknowl-
edgment is here made to Abbott's “Latin Prose through Eng-
lish Idiorn‚⁷' to Allen and Greenough's Grammar, and to Collar
and Daniell's “Beginner's Latin Book⁷' for a few forms of
statement taken from their pages3 and to the last for thev
“Glossarium Grammaticum,” the use of which was kindly
granted. ,

It remains to express hearty thanks to many scholars for
suggestions and criticisrns in the preparation of this book,
especially to Prof. H. S. Frieze, LL.D. and Prof. Elisha Jones
of Michigan University3 Dr. R. F. Leighton of Brooklyn3 M.
Grant Daniell, Principal of Chauncy-Hall School, Boston3 Prof.
M. M. Fisher of the University of Missouri: and to L. C. Hull,
Classical Master of the Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville‚ N.J.;
and J. H. Drake‚ Principal of the High School, Battle Creek,
Mich., who rendered valuable assistance by reading the proofs.
