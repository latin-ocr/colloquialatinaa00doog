HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS.

—*—-

1. Read each sentence through carefully several times until
you think you know its meaning3 but do not translate it into
English, for you must learn to read and understand Latin in the
natural order of its words and thoughts without an artificial re-
arrangement into the English order.

2. Go through an entire colloquium, as indicated above, before
you look up a single word. Remember that common sense is
the best key to a correct translation. When you have done
that, use the vocabulary as a last resort.

3. When you have thoroughly mastered the meaning of a
colloquium by a direct appeal to the Latin, translate it into good
English, tle. idiomatic English, and not into that curious com-
bination of English words and Latin constructions so often
heard in the class-room.

4. Remember that the significant part of a Latin word is its
termination. Train yourself frorn the outset to grasp at once all
the possibilities of construction that a termination may involve.

5. Α colloquium should always be learned by heart on the
rev1ew.

6. The “NOTES AND QUESTIONS” accompanying each exer-
cise should be thoroughly studied. The questions which are
not answered directly or by reference should be answered by
your own powers of observation. Often you will be led to a
general rule by a natural inference from what you have just seen
in an individual case.
