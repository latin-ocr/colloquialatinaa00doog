26 GERMAN.

Hez‘ne’s Die Harzrez‘se.

Edited, with Notes, by DR. A. N. VAN DAELL‚ Professor of Modern Lan-
guages, Mass. Institute of Technology. 82 pages. Paper. 23 cents.

Α ered Heine's brightest work, has long been desired. The au-
thor's poetry is in part accessible, but-and this remark applies to a
great many German writers-his prose-works are unknown in our
schools. And yet, whatever may be the merits and attractions of
poetry‚ a language ought to be studied mainly in its prose3 and surely
any one entirely ignorant of prose works cannot be said to have fairly
completed even the elementary stages of study.⁰

Heine's works generally—and the Harmez'se is no exception—
contain some words, sentences, or passages which are not suited to
the young3 but it is possible in many cases to take away obJ’ectionable
words without mutilating the thought. Sentences and passages have
been omitted whenever it has been deemed best. The editor has not
allowed himself any other liberties with the text, and believes that the
advantage which is offered students of becoming acquainted with
Heine's mingling of satire and poetry is a sufficient justification for
the publication of this somewhat incomplete text. The notes refer
only to such words or expressions as cannot readily be found in the
dictionaries in general use.

sible in this inexpensive form with judi-
cious notes and expurgations.
