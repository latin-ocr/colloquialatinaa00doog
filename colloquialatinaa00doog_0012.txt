It is thought that the other abbreviations need no explanation.

NB. —- At the head of each colloquium are references to Jones's, Collar
8( Daniell’s, and Leighton's beginners’ books. The references to the two
former indicate after what lesson or article the colloquium may best be
taken. Where more than one reference to Leighton is given, the first is to
the lesson in etymology which should precede the colloquium ,· those follow-
ing in parenthesis are to the Iessons teaching the required syntax. Since,
however, the notes are designed to clear up all syntactical difficulties, any
exercise may be successfully used after the requirements indicated by the
first reference have been met.
