NOTES AND QUESTIONS.

1. This colloquium is taken, with some changeS‚ from a scene
in the third act of the Adelphoe of Terence. Demea, the sternest
of fathers, believes his son Ctesipho, who is a scapegrace, to be a
model of virtue3 but Aeschinus, his brother's son, a worthless
profligate. SyruS, a slave, the young men’s chief assistant in all
their pranks, is engaged in preparing a feast for his young mas-
ters, who are within. Demea appears in search of Ctesipho, and
laments to Syrus the wickedness of Aeschinus. The cunning
slave falls in with what Demea says, and finally sends him off to
the country out of Ctesipho's way.
