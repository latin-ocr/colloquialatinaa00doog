HE distinctive features of this Reader ale: 1. It is purely intre-
ductory‚—simple and brief. 2. It is fullyrepresenlative,—for
all ordinary forms of reading. 3. It is adapted to the needs of all

Beginners.

First: The fact is recognised that, with the many complete and
easy texts now accessible‚ the scope of a Reader has become purely
elementary, and only introductory to independent reading. This view
has determined the extent of the book, less than 300 pages, and the
character of the selections. Difficult pieces are excluded altogether,
and literary criticism, history etc., are left for later study.

Second: The effort is made to familiarize the student with easy
German, in all the forms in which he may be called upon to read the
language: in German and Roman type, and in Schrift,· and in the
new and the old orthography,—-enough of each being given for prac-
tice, while German type, in the new orthography will predominate.

Third: The several parts are arranged for successive grades.
The first is isctcrlz‘near, for earliest reading, almost with the beginning
of the grammar. The second embraces familiar and easyprose fables,
stories‚ etc„ with copious notes3 the third, short and easy peenas, ex-
plained with special reference to peculiarities of practical form 3 the
fourth, light and entertaining prose,f0r rapz'd reading 3 and the fifth,
a selection of a few of the best letters, with several easy examples
in Schrift.

Classes may begin with Part Ι or II, and the whole book may be
accomplished in one term in college, or at most, in one year in school.

The notes and vocabulary have been wrought with extreme care,
and in the light of large experience in teaching. All the help thought
to be needed by beginners is given, but no more.

The book may be used with any German Grammar.
