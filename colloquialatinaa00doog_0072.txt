NOTES AND Qu ESTloNS.

1. This colloquium represents a scene in the lower world,
between Charon and Menippus, the Cynic philosopher, who
refuses to pay the former for ferrying him across the Styx.

2. The obol was a Greek coin worth about three and a half
cents. The custom was to put one in the mouth of the dead to
pay Charon.

3. Keep in mind—

a. That the gerund is a verbal noun, and may therefore stand
either alone or with an object.

b. That the gerundive is a participle used adjectively, agreeing
with a substantive in gender, number, and case.

c. That the gerundive with its substantive may be used for
any gerund with a substantive.

d. That the gerund with a direct object is commonly used
only in the genitive case and in the ablative without a preposi-
tion. In other cases the gerundive is preferred.

4. met added to personal pronouns makes them emphatic.

5. scienS, participle with concessive force.

6. Subject clause of result with ut omitted, as is usual after
necesse est.

7. Trans. J will net take this in exchangefor the obal.

8. Trans. That is none of your business. What is the literal
translation?
