Heallc’s Series of Modern Language T exis,

O supply the increasing demand for improved text-books, growing
out of the immense advance in modern language study during the
last decade, we have planned to publish a series of Tem, selected
and edited by the most eminent scholars, and carefully graded to meet
the wants of different classes of students.
This series will embrace such classics in these languages as are
commonly read in American colleges and scliools, with some others
that are well adapted for such use, but are not now available for lack

of suitable editions.

The editions will be handsomely printed and neatly bound, in cheap
and bandy volumes‚ suitable for the class-room or for private reading.
In each grade sufficient variety will be offered for students of all ages.
All the books will represent, in their respective gradez the latest
progress of scholarship and the best results of experience in teacliing.

or descriptive catalogue.
