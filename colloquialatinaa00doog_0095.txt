HIS Grammar was prepared with general reference to the needs
of our American schools and colleges. Its limit is determined

by the average time devoted to French in such institutions, and its
method, by practical as well as critical aims.

lee Fz'rst Part is devoted to such a brief, practical introduction
to the French language as will make the learner familiar with its first
essentials and enable him to begin reading with profit in half a term,
or even less time. It contains only 66 pages, exercises included.

The Second Part contains a methodicai presentation of French
etymology, syntax (with exercises at the end of the book), and versifi-
cation‚ as well as a brief sketch of the relation of French to the
Romance element in English, In the formation of rules the results
of modern philological research have always, as far as practicable‚
been considered. An abundant collection of examples‚ arranged
in columns, have been introduced to illustrate the rules of Syntax.
To aid the Latin student especially and quicken philological investiga-
tion, each chapter is preceded, parenthetically and unobtrusively, by
a brief historical survey of the subject under consideration. Two
sizes of type have been consistently used to denote what should be
studied in afirst course, and what be left for a second, or be used for
reference only. lee Second Part, contains about 300 pages. The
portion in heavy type is calculated to furnish work accessory to
reading for about a term and a half.
