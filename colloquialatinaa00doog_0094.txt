The tales are: “Aschenpilttel,⁷' “ Rotk'appchen,⁷' “Dornroschen‚⁷' “Der treue
Johannes,⁷' “Briiderchen und Schwesterchen,’⁷ “Konig Drosselbart‚⁷’ “Sneewitt-
chen,⁷⁷ “Hans im Gliickfl

HE charming simplicity of diction and thought in these tales ren—

ders them peculiarly fit for beginners to read. Such colloquial-

isms and idionis, as are found here in great abundance, are indispen-
sable to the student of the language and should be acquired early.

The Notes are very full, and in them more attention than usual is
paid to the very important subject of tlze construction of sentences,
a subject frequently neglected or postponed until the pupil begins
translating from English into German.

The vocabulary has been prepared with unusual care. Words,
'about the pronunciation of which there could be any doubt, are
properly marked. The principal parts of the verbs are given in full.

The Appendix contains full sets of the most concise rules (illus-
trated by examples) for the construction of German sentences, and
sor the deciension of adjectives.

The Tales are printed in the Roman character. Schiller's Der

Taucher is, however, presented in the German type, so that the ·
student may not lose all recollection of this character. This fine ι

specimen of ballad literature will afford the pupil the needed oppor-
tunity of becoming more or less familiar With poetical and higher
forms of diction and construction, as the Tales familiarize him with
colloquial and common forms, and will thus extend his knowledge of
the uses of words and of the language in general.
